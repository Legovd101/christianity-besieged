# Christianity Besieged

In Christianity Besieged, the Roman Empire's failure to control the Eastern Mediterranean makes them hostile to the spread of Christianity, keeping the religion for much of its history confined to the east. Its heyday in Western Europe would be short lived and danger now awaits the European Christians on all sides.

In the wake of Rome, the Sassanids would adopt Manichaeism and protect the Levant from Islamic jihad, later spreading their influence and faith deep into India. Manichaeism now prospers from eastern Europe to China.

Continuing to weather conflicts with the Roman Empire, the Germanic religious customs and traditions would syncretize with Hunnic Gothic traditions to form a more centralized religion, loosely organizing the tribes under a High King.

As Rome's periphery began to collapse to Germanic and Islamic invasion, they would ultimately adopt a Romanized Islamic sect in the 14th century, with its origins in Sicily and Morea. Spearheaded by the Liremans and the Ifriqyan Grand Mufti, who personally rose the Lireman Emperor to a caliph, Rome's solar empire would mostly die voluntarily, with pagan holdouts remaining in northern Italy.
